</details>

This workflow is automatically run by Bitrise on every commit on every branch. In addition to running `flutter analyze` to check for code quality, this workflow also runs `flutter test` to execute unit tests. Finally, `flutter drive` is run to execute integration tests. All test results are uploaded to the "Apps & Artifacts" tab on the build. Test.

#### `deploy` Workflow

This workflow creates both an APK for Android devices and an IPA for iOS devices. Both can be found on the Apps & Artifacts tab on the build page. While no actual signing is done in this sample, the appropriate steps are in place. The "Android Sign" and "Certificate and Profile Installer" steps have been added for Android and iOS respectively.
